# Some tips of cs231n spring 2017 assignments
Here I take some notes about some of my ideas that I think may be useful in my future programming.
# Assignment 1
## Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
In the KNN problem, the most tricky part is how to fully vectorlize the computation of l2 distance. Following these two steps may lead your way to the solution:
### 1. Decompose the final distance matrix.

## Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine
It really took me a long time to figure out the way of vectorlizing the computation of the gradient of the weight matrix. Here is my strategy:
